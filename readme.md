## Description

I created a simple blog page utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The user is able to enter their username blog title and blog content. This information is stored within local storage and transfered on the next page. This was a UT bootcamp assignment for unit 4.
I worked with two tutors on this project Chris and Jacob, utilized sample codes from class repo activities, and worked with classmates, Sam, Bryce, and Lindsey to varying degrees.
